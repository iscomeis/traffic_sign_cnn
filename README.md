# Traffic Sign Recognition using CNNs

- In this project, we explore the **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)**, a prominent multi-class classification challenge that was presented at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2011.
  
- The dataset consists of over **50,000 images** across **more than 40 classes**, providing a rich and lifelike database for traffic sign recognition. Our objective is to develop a robust model using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to accurately predict traffic signs from images.

- After training the model, we saved it as `traffic_signs_model.h5` and successfully uploaded it to **Hugging Face**. The model can be accessed via the following link: [Traffic Sign Detector](https://huggingface.co/spaces/comeis/traffic_sign_detector).
